Final Year Project


Wheelchairs are vital mobility aids for individuals with disabilities and the elderly, enabling independence in daily activities. However, wheelchair users, especially those who are alone, face an increased risk of falls, which can cause severe injuries and long-term health complications, significantly affecting their quality of life. As global populations age and healthcare demands grow, the rising use of wheelchairs underscores the urgent need for effective fall detection systems to ensure timely intervention and enhance user safety.
